    <p>You may read a lot this month about the population of New Orleans and the communities around it. Ten years after Hurricane Katrina, the metropolitan area has nearly 90,000 fewer people than when the 2000 census was taken. Based on that number alone, it looks like the region is about halfway down a long road to recovering all its lost population. </p>

<p>But there’s another way of thinking about these numbers that’s equally important: rates of change. The rates of demographic change in New Orleans reveal something surprising about the future of the place: As the large-scale return of population to the New Orleans area has tapered, pre-existing trends have picked up where they left off.</p>

<p>In fact, the rates of population change in the New Orleans area in 2013 and 2014 are incredibly similar to those in the years leading up to the storm. It turns out that one of the biggest disasters in American history -- and a decade of major reconstruction -- had little effect on the long-term population trends shaping the region: minority migration to the suburbs, a growing Hispanic community and more diversity overall.</p>

<p>To be sure, the New Orleans of tomorrow will not look like the New Orleans before Katrina. There are painful, permanent changes. Understanding how the population is shifting today will not bring back what was lost when the levees broke. But it is still important. According to Brookings Institution demographer William Frey, understanding demographic changes is essential in order to plan for economic changes, tax policy and the number of children the city will need to educate.</p>

<p>Here’s a closer look at what’s happening in the region today.</p>

            <p>As you can see in the bars to the left above, the city of New Orleans is a lot smaller today than it was before Katrina, and African-Americans have borne the brunt of that loss. Nearly 200,000 black people fled to escape the flooding, and only half that number have returned in the years since. Overall, the city has lost nearly one-third of its black population since 2000.</p>

<p>If you look only at the bar chart, it appears that New Orleans is midway through recovering all of its lost black population, but if you look at a different number — the rate at which the black population is growing — a different picture emerges. </p>

<p>Take a look at the line charts above. The dotted lines represent projected growth based on the average rate of growth during the five years prior to Hurricane Katrina. The solid lines represent what actually happened. The vertical gray line indicates the year that Katrina hit.</p>

<p>You can see that for five years before the storm, the solid green line representing New Orleans’ black population was neither rising nor falling. It was holding steady. Then the storm hit, and the population plunged. After a few years of steady recovery, the rate at which New Orleans’ black population is changing once again begins to resemble a flat line — not growing, not falling. By 2014, the dotted lines and the solid line are essentially parallel. That means New Orleans’ black population today is growing at the same rate that it was before the storm — it’s holding steady, and it remains around 60 percent of the total population. We can’t say for certain that this constitutes a trend, but the straightening of the line hints that this rate is likely to continue in the years to come.</p>

<p>This return to pre-Katrina rates of change has happened for every major population group.* By 2014 the pairs of lines are essentially parallel for Asians, Hispanics and whites, indicating that these groups have also returned to the same rates of growth as before the storm.</p>

            <p>The near-western suburbs of Jefferson Parish shrank in the years since 2000 — albeit slightly — but here, it is white residents who left and stayed away. There are 63,000 fewer white people in Jefferson Parish than there were in 2000. </p>

<p>However, unlike in New Orleans, most of these losses are not due to flooding. Whereas the African-American population in New Orleans had remained stable in the years before Katrina, white residents were already leaving Jefferson Parish at a rate of roughly 1.5 percent per year. Two-thirds of the total loss has happened since the storm, but those losses have been relatively gradual and, as the chart above illustrates, continue an established trend.</p>

<p>Jefferson Parish is also home to the region’s largest Hispanic population, much of which is made up of established immigrants from Honduras and other Central American countries. This population has nearly doubled since 2000, offsetting about half of the white population that was lost. This trend is seen throughout the metro area but is most pronounced in Jefferson Parish. According to Allison Plyer, executive director and chief demographer at the The Data Center, a think tank in Southeast Louisiana, steady growth among Hispanics was caused by an influx of young Hispanic men seeking rebuilding jobs. This change can also be seen in an increase in Spanish-speaking students at local schools.</p>

<p>Even though it shrank overall, Jefferson Parish’s new Hispanic residents have helped it leapfrog Orleans Parish as the most populous in the New Orleans metropolitan area.</p>

            <p>St. Bernard Parish is very small compared to Orleans or Jefferson, but the change here has been far more dramatic. In 2000, St. Bernard was 85 percent white and 10 percent black. By 2014, the white population had fallen by 50 percent, while the black population shot up by 89 percent.</p>

<p>Conflicts over these changes have made national headlines. In 2006, the St. Bernard Parish Council passed an ordinance requiring landlords to rent only to “blood relatives,” which was widely perceived as an attempt to prevent minorities from settling in the area. The Justice Department sued the parish under the Fair Housing Act, resulting in a $2.5 million settlement.</p>

<p>While the storm put these changes in sharper focus, a look at the charts above shows that even these dramatic changes were well underway before Katrina. The African-American population was already increasing sharply. Hispanic and Asian populations were already growing. Each group has now returned to pre-Katrina rates of growth.</p>

            <p>Across Lake Pontchartrain is the suburban parish of St. Tammany. Thanks to its wealthier population, and far less residential flooding than in other places, St. Tammany’s growth was virtually unaffected by Hurricane Katrina. In fact, this parish is the only one in the metropolitan area that has gotten significantly more populous in the years since the storm. As is visible in the charts above, all demographic groups have experienced significant growth.</p>

<p>Despite widespread claims that a large-scale relocation of displaced Orleans and St. Bernard residents is responsible for growth in St. Tammany, available data suggests otherwise. In fact, as our charts show, St. Tammany’s growth since the storm is solidly in line with what was happening before the storm. If regional migration is responsible for the growth of this parish, it continued a trend well underway.</p>

<p>In the three smaller parishes that complete the metropolitan area — St. Charles, St. John the Baptist and Plaquemines — population changes have been slight and reflective of increasing diversity throughout the region.</p>

            <h2>After A Rebuilding Boom, Metro Area Gets Back On Earlier Track</h2>

            

            <p>Before Katrina, overall population growth in the metropolitan area that includes the city of New Orleans and its suburban parishes was basically at a standstill — less than 1 percent per year. After several years of population boom during the rebuilding, it has stabilized at almost exactly the same rate of growth.</p>

<p>There is no guarantee today’s rates of population change will continue next year or the year after. However, according to Plyer, projecting demographics, at least over the short term, is the easy part: “Demographic changes are very predictable. The scale of it is not always predictable, but the makeup of it is predictable.” The impact of those changes — even when we see them coming — is much harder to forecast.</p>

<p>A devastating number of white and black residents have left the New Orleans region, seemingly for good. These shifts are sure to have far-reaching effects on the local economy, culture and traditions. A full third of the region’s total population loss has been made up by the growing numbers of Hispanic residents. These changes, combined with slowing rates of growth among other groups, make it clear the New Orleans region will not return to its pre-Katrina demographics anytime soon.</p>

<p><em>* Notice that the yellow lines representing the Hispanic population end up touching, unlike any other group. That’s because New Orleans reflects what’s happened in many places across the country over the past few years: thanks to greater immigration and higher birth rates, the Hispanic population is growing.</em></p>
