    <div id="graphic">
    
        <h3>The UNpacked Diet&reg;</h3>
        <h4>
            UNpack your pounds. UNpack&nbsp;your&nbsp;potential.<br />
            UNpack your food.
        </h4>
        
        <h5>Finally: a scientifically proven revolution in healthy&nbsp;eating!</h5>

        <p>
            <cite>Conventional wisdom</cite> tells us that
            <span>Establishes the UNpacked Diet as anti-establishment, offering the reader exclusive knowledge and membership in a community set apart from the ignorant mainstream.</span>
            unhealthy eating habits cause the obesity, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes that 
            <cite>plague our modern world</cite>.
            <span>Invokes the myth of paradise past, contrasted with a fallen modern world.</span>
            New research shows that diet can also cause psychological conditions like ADHD, Alzheimer&rsquo;s, schizophrenia, and autism.
        </p>

        <p>But which foods are the problem? Scientists and diet gurus &ldquo;whiplash&rdquo; us back and forth on the culprits. Do you trust the Paleo crowd? Then red meat is fine and grains are dangerous. Do you trust our government? Then whole grains are a must, and red meat will give you cancer and heart disease. Mainstream nutritionists will tell you it&rsquo;s all about energy balance&mdash;just eat fewer calories than you burn. But if you&rsquo;re among those who have tried diet and exercise, you <em>know</em> there&rsquo;s more to the story.</p>

        <p>
            <cite>Looking to traditional cultures</cite> raises even more questions.
            <span>Reinforces the myth of paradise past and &ldquo;noble savages,&rdquo; making unsubstantiated claims about healthy traditional cultures. There is no consensus about the extent to which diet plays a role in the health of these cultures, and most accounts of healthy traditional cultures are outdated, anecdotal, and unreliable.</span>
            We know that African Maasai tribes <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100517111910.htm">stay disease-free on a diet of raw milk and meat</a>. Yet we attribute the great health of the <a href="http://chinesefood.about.com/od/vegetarian/a/history.htm">ancient Chinese to their nearly vegetarian diet</a>. The Yanomamo Indians of Brazil <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1132118">thrive on a salt-free diet</a>, whereas the Japanese (one of the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17317693">healthiest modern cultures</a>) eat the highest-sodium diet in the world.</p>

        <p>Could it be that conventional wisdom is only <em>partially</em> right?</p>

        <p>
            <cite>There <em>is</em> something wrong with our diet. Of course there is! Look at the skyrocketing rates of obesity, chronic disease, cancer, and mental illness.</cite>
            <span>Apocalyptic, oversimplified alarmism about health is rarely accurate. Our life spans are longer than ever, and there is considerable scientific debate about supposed increases in conditions like ADHD, autism, and cancer.</span>
        </p>

        <p>But here&rsquo;s the shocking truth: the <em>type</em> of food we eat isn&rsquo;t the problem. Let&rsquo;s ask again: What has <em>really</em> changed? 
 
        <p>When I think of 
            <cite>my 95-year-old grandmother</cite>,
            <span>Anecdotes about longevity are powerful and common in religious texts, but do not constitute decisive evidence of anything.</span>
            I always think of a glass jar&mdash;her kitchen was filled with them. At the end of the summer, she would stuff jars with fruits and vegetables to preserve and eat all year long.</p>

        <p>Today, glass is infrequently used to store food, and for one simple reason: 
            <cite>Big Food wants to keep things cheap.</cite>
            <span>Evokes a narrative of good and evil in which anything associated with industry is evil, and reinforces the reader’s ability to align with &ldquo;good&rdquo; simply by following a diet.</span>
            Gone is Grandmother’s pantry. Kitchens are now filled with 
            <cite>plastics, metals, and heavily bleached and processed papers</cite>.
            <span>Appeals again to fear of modernity and paradise past.</span>
            Milk, which once came delivered fresh in glass jugs, sits for days in plastic containers or plastic-lined cartons. Our grandparents brought fresh produce home in crates and cartons. We get our fruits and veggies shrink-wrapped in plastic and Styrofoam.</p>
 
        <p>Our Paleolithic ancestors ate <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/paleofantasy">a wide variety of diets depending on where they lived</a>. Their food was wrapped in 
            <cite>Nature&rsquo;s packaging</cite>: peels and husks. 
            <span>Contrasts fallen modernity with an idealized, benevolent vision of Nature with a capital N.</span>
            Wherever it is found, from gas station mini-marts to giant Walmarts, food today almost always comes packaged. And even when it doesn&rsquo;t, we place it in plastic bags ourselves before taking it home.</p>

        <p>If we are willing to ignore old ways of thinking about food, the answer to our dietary problems is obvious. The whiplash goes away when we stop trying to figure which <em>type</em> of food is the dietary villain, or which new fad diet will help us lose weight. Science can&rsquo;t tell us which diet is right because there <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> a right diet!</p>

        <p>Here&rsquo;s what all those diet gurus and nutritionists don&rsquo;t want you know, because they&rsquo;d be out of a job. The most common supermarket and fast-food materials&mdash;plastic, aluminum, tin, even recycled paper&mdash;contain dangerous chemicals and heavy metals that fatten us up and destroy our health.</p>

        <p>
            <cite>The real villain is in the packaging.</cite>
            <span>Identifies a satisfyingly simple scapegoat to blame for all our health problems.</span>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Plastics Are Not Fantastic</strong></p>

        <p>The dangers of plastics are no surprise to scientists, who have been studying their negative health effects for decades. Researchers and health officials have voiced concerns about 
            <cite>&ldquo;nanoplastics&rdquo;</cite> (small plastic particles) 
            <span>Pseudoscientific jargon creates authority. Nanoplastic is a real term, but it does not mean &ldquo;small plastic particles.&rdquo; It sure sounds scary, though.</span>
            that get into our food by &ldquo;leaching&rdquo; or &ldquo;migration.&rdquo; Although 
            <cite>Big Chem and Big Food</cite> have done their best to suppress this information,
            <span>Big Chem and Big Food = Deceptive Satan.</span>
            numerous studies prove the health risks are enormous.</p>

        <p>Unlike low carb vs. low fat, 
            <cite>there is no debate</cite> about the dangers of these modern food storage materials.
            <span>False. Just false.</span>
        </p>

        <p>You may have heard about the most notorious of these plastics, BPA. Polycarbonate plastics (containing BPA) are extremely common in US food packaging. In 2004, the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2199288/">CDC found traces of BPA in nearly all the urine samples it collected</a> (93 percent of adults), and scientists predict that today the number would be over 99 percent. 
            <cite>The source of this BPA is our diets.</cite>
            <span>Seems alarming, but there are traces of many things in our bodies that are only dangerous at high doses. The dose makes the poison.</span>
        </p>

        <p>The dangers of this poisonous endocrine disrupter are
            <cite>almost too numerous to list</cite>.
            <span>The terrifying associations in the paragraph are based on a few in-vitro and animal studies. Establishing facts about what causes cancer in humans requires much more evidence.</span>
            BPA mimics estrogen and has been shown to <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/06/140623103937.htm">grow breast cancer cells</a>. Exposure to BPA early in life <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/243626.php">leads to</a> precancerous changes in glands, altered brain development, lower sperm counts and chromosomal abnormalities in eggs. <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111003080421.htm">Prenatal exposure to BPA</a> 
            <cite>correlates with breast cancer later in life</cite>, 
            <span>A single study, conducted in primates, with very tentative conclusions.</span>
            a fact so alarming that the 
            <cite>Breast Cancer Fund</cite> urges people
            <span>Organizations don&rsquo;t always make recommendations based on sound science. The Breast Cancer Fund is basing its recommendations on the kind of studies mentioned above.</span>
            to <a href="http://www.breastcancerfund.org/reduce-your-risk/tips/eat-live-better">avoid <em>all BPA plastics</em></a>. 
            They also recommend eliminating canned food, since BPA is commonly used in can lining.</p>

        <p>As use of plastic increases, <a href="http://www.articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2014/04/02/ environmental-toxin-exposure.aspx">so do rates of mental disorders</a>
            <cite>like ADHD and autism</cite>.
            <span>Incredibly controversial. Many experts have suggested that rates of autism are not, in fact, drastically rising, and better detection and expanded criteria account for much of the perceived &ldquo;epidemic.&rdquo;</span>
            While the two seem intuitively unrelated, scientists see a connection. Irva Hertz-Picciotto, chief of the Division of Environmental and Occupational Health at UC Davis, believes that because plastic packaging interferes with the body&rsquo;s natural hormonal system, 
            <cite>it could</cite> &ldquo;play a role in autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders.&rdquo;
            <span>It could play a role&hellip;or it could not.</span>
            <a href="http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2011/06/07/scientists-warn-of-chemical-autism-link">Other doctors</a> suspect plastic packaging
            <cite>may disrupt thyroid hormone</cite>
            critical for brain development.
            <span>It may&hellip;or it may not.</span>
            They point out that thyroid dysfunction is particularly common in children with autism.</p>

        <p>And those migraines? They aren&rsquo;t just in your head. <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-daily- headaches/in-depth/headaches/art-20046729">According to the Mayo Clinic</a>, plastics may be responsible. The hormones estrogen and progesterone play key roles in regulating menstruation and pregnancy, which affect headache-causing chemicals in the brain. Steady estrogen levels improve headaches, but altered levels make them worse. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24189132">A University of Kansas study</a> found that hormone-disrupting plastics 
            <cite>caused migraine symptoms</cite>,
            <span>&hellip;in rats.</span>
            including light and sound sensitivity. Chemicals in plastic food packaging 
            <cite>have also been linked to</cite>
            <span>Lots of citations doesn’t mean good science. Every &ldquo;link&rdquo; in this sentence is based on a single study, sometimes with very tenuous conclusions.</span>
            <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2854784/">heart disease</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/diabetes-plastic-estrogen-mimic-provokes-insulin-resistance">adult onset diabetes</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23706605">high blood pressure</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19478717">early puberty</a>, <a href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ad/2014/743616/">allergies</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15471731">asthma</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16540110">anxiety</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3136324/">unattractiveness</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20467048">erectile dysfunction</a>, <a href="http://www.rodalenews.com/multiple-chemical-sensitivity">depression</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2643957/">schizophrenia</a>, and  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22610992">Alzheimer&rsquo;s</a>.
 
        <p>So plastics make us sick—but do they also make us fat? The answer is clear. Scientists have known for over a decade that plastics cause obesity in rats, and recently found that the link extends to humans.  Author Joseph Stromberg in 2012 <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/ist/?next=/science-nature/is-the-can- worse-than-the-soda-study-finds-correlation-between-bpa-and- obesity-40894828">cited</a> the first large-scale study to find 
            <cite>a significant link between BPA and obesity</cite>.
            <span>Correlation is not causation.</span>
        <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0065399">A 2013 study found</a> that girls with higher levels of BPA <em>were five times more likely to be overweight</em>.</p>

        <p>It is no coincidence that when plastic use took off, we started packing on the pounds.</p>
