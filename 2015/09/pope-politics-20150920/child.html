    <h1>How The Pope Makes Both U.S. Parties Uncomfortable</h1>

                <td data-title="Clashes With" class="parties">Both Parties</td>
                <td data-title="What The Pope Has&nbsp;Said" class="pope">&ldquo;[C]oncern for the protection of nature is also incompatible with the justification of abortion. How can we genuinely teach the importance of concern for other vulnerable beings, however troublesome or inconvenient they may be, if we fail to protect a human embryo, even when its presence is uncomfortable and creates difficulties?&rdquo; <br /><br /> But the pope later this year said, &ldquo;&hellip;I have decided, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, to concede to all priests for the Jubilee Year the discretion to absolve of the sin of abortion those who have procured it and who, with contrite heart, seek forgiveness for it.&rdquo; </td>
                <td data-title="What Politicians Have&nbsp;Said" class="pols"><em>Democrats</em>:&ldquo;The Democratic Party strongly and unequivocally supports Roe v. Wade and a woman&rsquo;s right to make decisions regarding her pregnancy, including a safe and legal abortion, regardless of ability to pay. We oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right.&rdquo; <br /><br /> <em>Republicans</em>: &ldquo;We affirm the dignity of women by protecting the sanctity of human life &hellip; We call on the government to permanently ban all federal funding and subsidies for abortion and healthcare plans that include abortion coverage.&rdquo;</td>
                <td data-title="The Takeaway" class="takeaway">Democrats remain the party of abortion rights. The Catholic Church, meanwhile, is still staunchly opposed to abortion. However, his (slight) softening of the church's stance takes the temperature of the debate over this issue down a notch.</td>
            </tr>

                <td data-title="What The Pope Has&nbsp;Said" class="pope">&ldquo;Marriage is between a man and a woman. &hellip; We have to look at different cases and evaluate them in their variety.&rdquo;</td>
                <td data-title="What Politicians Have&nbsp;Said" class="pols">&ldquo;The Republican platform committee resoundingly rejected an amendment &hellip; that would have endorsed civil unions for gay couples.&rdquo;</td>
                <td data-title="The Takeaway" class="takeaway">The pope and the church are still firmly opposed to same-sex marriage, and that clashes with Democrats. But Francis’ statement here was taken as an indication of some potential openness to civil unions. The GOP platform, meanwhile, continues to stand firmly against any moderation on marriage.</td>

                <td data-title="What Politicians Have&nbsp;Said" class="pols">&ldquo;Experience has shown that, in caring for the land and water, private ownership has been our best guarantee of conscientious stewardship, while the worst instances of environmental degradation have occurred under government control.&rdquo;</td>
                <td data-title="The Takeaway" class="takeaway">The pope has called on governments to take greater steps on climate change and not to let short-term economic growth cloud their judgment. The GOP platform calls for conservation but emphasizes the role of the private sector and citizens while "reining in the EPA."</td>

                <td data-title="What The Pope Has&nbsp;Said" class="pope">&ldquo;Sorry, some people think that in order to be good Catholics we have to breed like rabbits, right? Responsible parenthood: this is why there are marriage support groups in the Church with people who are experts on such issues; and there are pastors and I know that there are many licit ways out that have helped this.&rdquo;</td>
                <td data-title="What Politicians Have&nbsp;Said" class="pols">&ldquo;The President and the Democratic Party believe that women have a right to control their reproductive choices. Democrats support access to affordable family planning services &hellip; The Affordable Care Act ensures that women have access to contraception in their health insurance plans&hellip;&rdquo;</td>
                <td data-title="The Takeaway" class="takeaway">The pope's comments were striking for Catholics who have long heard a church message – veiled or overt – that the more children, the better. But the pope did not go so far as to endorse artificial contraception to limit childbearing – despite about <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/pope-francis-faces-church-divided-over-doctrine-global-poll-of-catholics-finds/2014/02/08/e90ecef4-8f89-11e3-b227-12a45d109e03_story.html">4 in 5 Catholics worldwide</a> supporting its use. Instead, Francis’ comments were seen as endorsement of church-endorsed &ldquo;natural family planning.&rdquo;</td>

                <td data-title="What The Pope Has&nbsp;Said" class="pope">&ldquo;&hellip;[S]ome people continue to defend trickle-down theories which assume that economic growth, encouraged by a free market, will inevitably succeed in bringing about greater justice and inclusiveness in the world. This opinion, which has never been confirmed by the facts, expresses a crude and naïve trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power and in the sacralized workings of the prevailing economic system.&rdquo;</td>
                <td data-title="What Politicians Have&nbsp;Said" class="pols">&ldquo;We offer our Republican vision of a free people using their God-given talents, combined with hard work, self-reliance, ethical conduct, and the pursuit of opportunity, to achieve great things for themselves and the greater community.&rdquo;</td>
                <td data-title="The Takeaway" class="takeaway">The GOP platform endorses the free market principles of deregulation and lower taxes as a path to job creation.</td>

                <td data-title="What The Pope Has&nbsp;Said" class="pope">&ldquo;Not infrequently, the arrival of migrants, displaced persons, asylum-seekers and refugees gives rise to suspicion and hostility. There is a fear that society will become less secure, that identity and culture will be lost, that competition for jobs will become stiffer and even that criminal activity will increase ... A change of attitude towards migrants and refugees is needed on the part of everyone, moving away from attitudes of defensiveness and fear.&rdquo;</td>
                <td data-title="What Politicians Have&nbsp;Said" class="pols">&ldquo;In an age of terrorism, drug cartels, human trafficking, and criminal gangs, the presence of millions of unidentified persons in this country poses grave risks to the safety and the sovereignty of the United States. Our highest priority, therefore, is to secure the rule of law both at our borders and at ports of entry. … Granting amnesty only rewards and encourages more law breaking.&rdquo;</td>
                <td data-title="The Takeaway" class="takeaway">While some Republicans have been in favor of immigration reform, the GOP has also recently been on the side of more restrictions. Some more extreme party members like Iowa Rep. Steve King and Donald Trump have also spread (<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mythical-connection-between-immigrants-and-crime-1436916798">unfounded</a>) fears about immigrants as dangerous.</td>

                <td data-title="What The Pope Has&nbsp;Said" class="pope">Vatican Spokesman Federico Lombardi said, &ldquo;The agreement on the Iranian nuclear program is viewed in a positive light by the Holy See. It constitutes an important outcome of the negotiations carried out so far, although continued efforts and commitment on the part of all involved will be necessary in order for it to bear fruit.&rdquo;</td>
                <td data-title="What Politicians Have&nbsp;Said" class="pols">RNC Chairman Reince Priebus released a <a href="https://www.gop.com/rnc-statement-on-iran-nuclear-deal/">statement</a> following the announcement of the Iran deal, saying, &ldquo;The Obama administration did not even meet its own goals with this deal. If implemented, this agreement will cement the Obama-Clinton foreign policy legacy: a richer, more powerful, more dangerous, legitimized Iran.&rdquo;</td>
                <td data-title="The Takeaway" class="takeaway">Opposition to Obama's Iran deal was mostly concentrated among Republicans, though a few Democrats also joined in opposing it.</td>

                <td data-title="What The Pope Has&nbsp;Said" class="pope">The Vatican in May 2015 announced <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/14/world/middleeast/vatican-to-recognize-palestinian-state-in-new-treaty.html?_r=0">a treaty</a> brokered with &ldquo;the state of Palestine.&rdquo; This signaled the Vatican's first legal shift from recognizing the Palestinian Liberation Organization to the state of Palestine. </td>
                <td data-title="What Politicians Have&nbsp;Said" class="pols"><em>Republicans</em>: &ldquo;[W]e envision two democratic states &mdash; Israel with Jerusalem as its capital and Palestine &mdash; living in peace and security. For that to happen, the Palestinian people must support leaders who reject terror, embrace the institutions and ethos of democracy, and respect the rule of law.&rdquo;
<br /><br />
<em>Democrats</em>: &ldquo;A just and lasting Israeli-Palestinian accord, producing two states for two peoples, would contribute to regional stability and help sustain Israel’s identity as a Jewish and democratic state. At the same time, the President has made clear that there will be no lasting peace unless Israel’s security concerns are met.</td>
                <td data-title="The Takeaway" class="takeaway">Both the Democratic and Republican parties are in favor of a Palestinian state, but only on certain conditions. The Vatican, meanwhile, in that treaty recognized Palestinian statehood — a decision that <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/israel-hawks-to-pop-francis-stay-out-of-politics-117929">angered</a> some GOP Israel hawks.</td>

                <td data-title="What The Pope Has&nbsp;Said" class="pope">&ldquo;If someone is gay and is searching for the Lord and has good will, then who am I to judge him?&rdquo;</td>
                <td data-title="What Politicians Have&nbsp;Said" class="pols"><em>Republicans</em>: &ldquo;We reaffirm our support for a Constitutional amendment defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman. We applaud the citizens of the majority of States which have enshrined in their constitutions the traditional concept of marriage, and we support the campaigns underway in several other States to do so.&rdquo;
<br /><br />
<em>Democrats</em>: &ldquo;We support marriage equality and support the movement to secure equal treatment under law for same-sex couples. We also support the freedom of churches and religious entities to decide how to administer marriage as a religious sacrament without government interference.&rdquo;</td>
                <td data-title="The Takeaway" class="takeaway">The church's stance on defining marriage as a union between one man and one woman is unlikely to change anytime soon. It lines up with the GOP's definition and runs counter to the Democratic Party’s position. However, some see the pope's comments as moving away from traditional rhetoric on gays and lesbians and indicative of a shifting tone of the church.</td>

                <td data-title="What The Pope Has&nbsp;Said" class="pope">&ldquo;For some months now, we have witnessed an event which fills us with hope: the process of normalizing relations between two peoples following years of estrangement. &hellip; I urge political leaders to persevere on this path and to develop all its potentialities as a proof of the high service which they are called to carry out on behalf of the peace and well-being of their peoples, of all America, and as an example of reconciliation for the entire world.&rdquo;</td>
                <td data-title="What Politicians Have&nbsp;Said" class="pols">While Obama has had <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/why-the-gop-congress-could-be-trouble-for-obama-in-cuba-119668">a few GOP allies</a> on Cuba, many prominent Republicans have spoken out against him on the topic: &ldquo;As president, I would not honor this decision with Cuba and I would close the embassy until the Castro brothers actually change their behavior,&rdquo; Lindsey Graham <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/why-the-gop-congress-could-be-trouble-for-obama-in-cuba-119668#ixzz3mTZROLrr">said in July</a>. And Sen. Marco Rubio has said Obama's normalization of relations <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/10/marco-rubio-cuba-obama-policy-roll-back">violates the law.</a></td>
                <td data-title="The Takeaway" class="takeaway">Democratic politicians are by far more supportive of re-establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba than Republicans are, and that carries over to the <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2015/07/21/growing-public-support-for-u-s-ties-with-cuba-and-an-end-to-the-trade-embargo/">general public</a> as well.</td>
