    <h1>Eggs Frozen At An Earlier Age Have A Higher Chance Of Success</h1>
    <h2>Probability of a live birth, based on number of eggs thawed and patient&#8217;s age at the time eggs were frozen.</h2>

        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <p>&mdash;&nbsp;&#8220;Live birth&#8221; is defined as the delivery of one or more infants. Twins or other multiple births are counted as a single &#8220;live birth.&#8221;<br />
&mdash;&nbsp;Rates shown are for eggs that were &#8220;flash-frozen&#8221; using vitrification, a process which typically results in 80 percent or more eggs surviving the thaw.</p>
