    <h1>So Far, Few Attempts To Use Frozen Eggs; Fewer Births</h1>
    <h2>In a &#8220;thaw cycle,&#8221; frozen eggs are thawed, fertilized and implanted. Of the eggs frozen since 2009, only a small percentage have been thawed for use. And of those attempts, 20-25 percent have resulted in a child.</h2>

        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <p>&mdash;&nbsp;&#8220;Live birth&#8221; is defined as the delivery of one or more infants. Twins or other multiple births are counted as a single &#8220;live birth.&#8221;<br />
&mdash;&nbsp;Some of the thawed eggs may have been frozen with an older method that&#8217;s largely been abandoned because of its lower success rate. Almost all eggs frozen in recent years are &#8220;flash-frozen&#8221; with vitrification, which typically results in 80 percent or more eggs surviving the thaw.</p>
