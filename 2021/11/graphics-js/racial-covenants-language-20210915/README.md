This graphic uses the [Masonry](https://masonry.desandro.com/methods.html) JS library for laying out irregularly-sized blocks of text on larger screens. (The final graphic only used 3 excerpts, so this ended up being a bit overkill. In development, there were several more, and this lib was more useful.)
