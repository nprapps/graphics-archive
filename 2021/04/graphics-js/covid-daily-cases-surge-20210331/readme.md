## How to update

- This graphic pulls from the `timeseries_states` data in the U.S. map page sheets.
- To update, copy over new data into a new line in the `working` sheet for the graphic and pull down the formulas in the `new_cases`and `7day_avg` columns to match.
- Update the date in the subhed in the `labels` sheet. Since we're using the `timeseries_states` data, the date should usually be yesterday's date. Refresh and republish.
