                    Life expectancy has gone up slowly but surely in this period &#8212; the latest for which official statistics have been completed. But preliminary data for 2015 suggest that life expectancy dipped slightly, by about a month, in 2015. This may be a one-time blip or the beginning of a trend. The 2014 data show that life expectancy for non-Hispanic whites went down by about a month (0.1 year) but did not affect the overall 2014 rate, which was unchanged from 2013.
