                    Starting in 2011, the growth in premiums for employer-paid insurance began to slow. A report from the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust concluded that the introduction of Obamacare &#8220;does not appear to be causing major disruptions&#8221; to the main health insurance market in this country.

                    From the KFF/HRET report for 2016, KFF CEO Drew Altman says: &#8220;We&#8217;re seeing premiums rising at historically slow rates, which helps workers and employers alike, but it&#8217;s made possible in part by the more rapid rise in the deductibles workers must pay.&#8221;
