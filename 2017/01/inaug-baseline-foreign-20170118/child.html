                    Obama&#8217;s term in office coincided with the so-called Arab Spring revolts against dictators in the Middle East. But the overall picture for freedom around the world didn&#8217;t change much. The number of countries considered &#8220;free&#8221; by Freedom House, as defined by a number of measures pertaining to things like corruption, civil rights, and free and fair elections, has changed little since around the time Obama took office.

                    President Obama pledged to end U.S. major combat operations in two wars, Iraq and Afghanistan, launched by President Bush. Obama did remove the large ground forces sent to these countries. But Obama expanded drone strikes and extended them to additional countries. As Obama leaves office, the U.S. military is carrying out almost daily airstrikes in three countries (Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan) and has about 15,000 military personnel in these countries.

China claims much of the South China Sea for itself; an international tribunal last year rejected China&#8217;s claims.
