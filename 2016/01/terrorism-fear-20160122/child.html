    <h1>Rising Fears Of Terrorism</h1>
    <h2>In the wake of the San Bernardino shooting, Americans&#8217; belief in the likelihood of terrorist attacks hit levels comparable to those just after 9/11, according to CBS/New York Times polls. As of early December, 79 percent of people believed it was &#8220;very&#8221; or &#8220;somewhat likely&#8221; that the U.S. would suffer a terrorist attack &#8220;within the next few months.&#8221;</h2>
