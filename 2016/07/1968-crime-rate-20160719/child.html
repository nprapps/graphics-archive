    <h1>Violent Crime, 1968 Vs. Today</h1>
    <h2>Today&#8217;s rate of violent crime (a category that includes murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault) is higher than it was in 1968, according to the latest data. As of 2014, there were around 366 violent crimes per 100,000 people, compared to about 298 then. However, violent crime today is far lower than it has been in recent decades. (All that said, crime data is notoriously messy. See the footnote for an explanation.)</h2>

        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <p>These data, as with much crime data, are imperfect. These numbers come from Uniform Crime Reports &mdash; figures that the FBI collects from law enforcement around the country. That means they do not include crimes that are not reported to the police. Another series, the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), in which the FBI surveys Americans to ask if they have been victims of a crime, shows violent crime to have held somewhat steady from the early 1970s through the 1990s. The UCR includes some crimes the NCVS doesn&#8217;t, like homicide, arson, and crimes against young children. NCVS, meanwhile, includes sexual assault (including threats thereof), which UCR does not.
