                    Castile is pulled over for a “reduced speed required” violation. The statute requires drivers to slow down when, for example, an emergency vehicle is approaching. So he is charged with “basic speed” and for having “no insurance.” Charges for driving with a suspended license and no seat belt use are dismissed. He is fined&nbsp;$130.
