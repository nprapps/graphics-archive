                <td class="clinton" data-title="Hillary Clinton">As secretary of state, Clinton described TPP in glowing terms. Later, she stepped back from that support, saying she had to wait for the final details before weighing in. She announced her opposition in October 2015, after the Obama administration announced the deal was complete.</td>
                <td class="sanders" data-title="Bernie Sanders">Sanders has opposed the international trade agreement.</td>

                <td class="clinton" data-title="Hillary Clinton">For much of 2015, Clinton avoided taking a position on the issue, citing her former position at the State Department. She announced her opposition in September, and the Obama administration rejected the pipeline in November 2015.</td>
                <td class="sanders" data-title="Bernie Sanders">Sanders has opposed the pipeline expansion.</td>

                <td class="issue" data-title="">Wall Street reform</td>
                <td class="clinton" data-title="Hillary Clinton">Clinton discussed Wall Street excesses in her first remarks of the campaign; several months later, she  <a href="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2015/10/08/wall-street-work-for-main-street/">announced</a> a multifaceted Wall Street reform proposal that included defending Dodd-Frank, going after shadow banking and holding individuals and corporations accountable. There is ongoing disagreement about which candidate&#8217;s plan would be more effective.</td>
                <td class="sanders" data-title="Bernie Sanders">Sanders has long advocated for <a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/reforming-wall-street/">reform</a> in the financial system. In May 2015, he <a href="http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/tbtfleg?inline=file">introduced a bill</a> to break up the big banks and reinstate the Glass-Steagall Act. He decries what he sees as a double standard of young people of color going to jail for marijuana possession while no one went to prison for their involvement in the financial crisis of 2008.</td>

                <td class="clinton" data-title="Hillary Clinton">Clinton initially said she would support a constitutional amendment to overturn <em>Citizens United.</em> In an NPR interview in January 2016, she said that overturning the ruling would be part of a <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/01/20/463748438/transcript-nprs-interview-with-hillary-rodham-clinton">litmus test</a> for Supreme Court appointments. Meanwhile, she does have a superPAC behind her, Priorities USA, arguing that she has to play by the rules as they exist now to be competitive in November. Her campaign raises money through a mix of large-dollar fundraisers (more than $300,000 for dinner with George Clooney!) and smaller individual contributions.</td>
                <td class="sanders" data-title="Bernie Sanders">In an interview on CBS&#8217;s <em>Face the Nation,</em> Sanders said overturning <em>Citizens United</em> would be part of a <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/face-the-nation-transcripts-may-10-2015-huckabee-sanders-gingrich/">litmus test</a> for Supreme Court justices he would appoint. He also says he will not have a superPAC, and he has resisted big-dollar fundraisers. In March alone Sanders raised more than $40 million from small-dollar donations.</td>
