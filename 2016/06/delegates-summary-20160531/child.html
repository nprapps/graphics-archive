        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <p>1.&nbsp;Ted Cruz and John Kasich dropped out of the race after the Indiana Republican Primary on May 3. Marco Rubio dropped out after the Florida Republican Primary on March 15. Other candidates who dropped out but won delegates in early contests: Ben Carson (7), Jeb Bush (4), Carly Fiorina (1), Mike Huckabee (1), Rand Paul (1)<br />
2.&nbsp;Each state and party has its own rules for awarding delegates to candidates. Some state parties award delegates proportionally depending on the results of a caucus, primary or party convention. Other party primaries and caucuses are winner-take-all. Still others are hybrids. Additionally, there are 143 unbound Republican delegates from 7 states and territories (American Samoa, Colorado, Guam, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Virgin Islands and Wyoming) who may vote as they wish at the national convention. AP&#8217;s tallies include unbound delegates who have expressed support for particular candidates.<br />
3.&nbsp;After winners are called, state parties do not always immediately award all delegates (and AP does not always immediately account for all delegates in its estimates). Sometimes the delay is to allow for full tabulation of votes, or because there are further steps involved in the state party nomination process.</p>
