                <li class="r0">After three weeks dominated by the battle among Republicans who want his job, President Obama had the spotlight tonight. Read through to see how he argued that he's made progress on solving the nation's problems -- and how GOP leaders responded that the nation is still on the wrong path.        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 11:27 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r1">On education, it's not clear where the money would come from for the president's idea about partnerships between business and community colleges, NPR's Claudio Sanchez reports:          (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2012/01/24/145817793/can-obama-deliver-on-new-education-commitments">link</a>) <span class="date">January 24 2012, 11:19 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r2">Another note -- the 2010 health care overhaul got barely a mention, NPR's Julie Rovner says:         (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2012/01/24/145816132/analysis-landmark-health-overhaul-gets-barely-a-mention">link</a>) <span class="date">January 24 2012, 11:18 PM</span>

    </li>
            <li class="r5">NPR's David Welna notes that when the president said half the money spent on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan should be spent to pay down the national debt, he didn't mention that the wars have been "deficit-financed" -- in other words, paid for with borrowed money.         <span class="date">January 24 2012, 11:05 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r6">NPR's Tom Gjelten notes that while Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels mentioned the debt crisis in Europe during the GOP response, "President Obama had not one word to say about the European debt crisis, which is arguably (according to the International Monetary Fund) the single greatest threat right now to the global economy."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 11:00 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r7">PolitiFact.com's first ruling: Obama was "half true" when he tied recent job growth to policies of his administration.

    </li>
            <li class="r8">Obama adviser David Plouffe on MSNBC: "The president tonight laid out a very optimistic blueprint. He made clear he’s not going to stand by and allow gridlock to block progress."
        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:54 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r9">GOP presidential contender Mitt Romney, on MSNBC, about the president's address: "What he says and what he has done are so dramatically different."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:52 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r10">Some of the early headlines ... <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>: "Obama Makes Pitch For Second Term." ... <em>Los Angeles Times</em>: "Obama Delivers A Confrontational Address." ... <em>The Washington Post</em>: "Obama Focuses On Economic Inequality."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:50 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r11">"Divided" is the word that many USAToday.com readers seem to have zeroed in on when asked for their response to the president's address.

    </li>
            <li class="r12">"Republicans," says Gov. Daniels, "will speak for those who believe in the dignity and capacity of the individual citizen."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:43 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r13">Daniels brings up a favorite talking point of Republicans: "In word and deed the president and his allies tell us we just cannot handle ourselves in this complex and perilous world without their protection. ... We might even pick the wrong light bulb." He's referring there to rules that would require more efficient bulbs.         (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1211/70621.html">link</a>) <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:41 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r14">Gov. Daniels says "no feature of the Obama presidency has been sadder than its constant efforts to divide us, to curry favor with some Americans by castigating others."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:37 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r15">Daniels says "the dumb way" to overhaul the tax system "is to raise rates in a broken and complex tax system. ... The better course is to stop sending the wealthy benefits they do not need" and to end "tax preferences" that the rich don't deserve.        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:36 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r16">The nation can no longer afford to send pension checks to millionaires, Gov. Daniels says. "We must fashion a new and affordable safety net."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:35 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r17">Daniels gets to the quote that will make for headlines: "The extremism that stifles the development of homegrown energy, or cancels a perfectly safe pipeline that would employ tens of thousands, or jacks up consumer utility bills for no improvement in either human health or world temperature, is a <strong>pro-poverty policy</strong>."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:34 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r18">"The only way up for those suffering tonight and the only way out of the dead end of debt," Gov. Daniels says, is "a private economy that begins to grow jobs."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:33 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r19">Gov. Daniels compares the nation's financial state to that of "Greece, Spain and other European countries facing catastrophe."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:32 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r20">"He seems to sincerely believe we can build a middle class out of government jobs paid for" with taxes, Gov. Daniels says of the president.         <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:30 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r21">But the state of the union is not good, Gov. Daniels says. For instance, "the president has put us on a course" to make the federal debt "radically worse," he says.         <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:30 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r22">Gov. Daniels begins by saying Republicans salute the president for the killing of Osama bin Laden and he lauds Obama and the first lady for setting a good example for families.
        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:29 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r23">Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana just began the GOP response.         <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:28 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r24">NPR's Tom Gjelten notes this response from the president to Republican charges that America's influence around the world is in decline: "That's not how people feel from Tokyo to Berlin; from Cape Town to Rio, where opinions of America are higher than they've been in years," Obama said. Republicans, though, would argue that American needs to be respected as much as liked, Tom says.         <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:24 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r25">Coming shortly: The Republican response, delivered by Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels.        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:18 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r26">And as he finishes, Obama closes the circle on his theme: "As long as we’re joined in common purpose, as long as we maintain our common resolve, our journey moves forward, our future is hopeful, and the state of our Union will always be strong."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:17 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r27">"This nation is great because we worked as a team," Obama says. "This nation is great because we get each other’s backs. And if we hold fast to that truth, in this moment of trial, there is no challenge too great; no mission too hard."
        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:17 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r28">"So it is with America," Obama says. "Each time I look at that flag, I’m reminded that our destiny is stitched together like those fifty stars and those thirteen stripes.  No one built this country on their own.  This Nation is great because we built it together."         <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:16 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r29">"More than that, the mission only succeeded because every member of that unit trusted each other," says Obama, "because you can’t charge up those stairs, into darkness and danger, unless you know that there’s someone behind you, watching your back."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:15 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r30">"One of the young men involved in the raid later told me that he didn’t deserve credit for the mission," Obama continues. "It only succeeded, he said, because every single member of that unit did their job."
        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:14 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r31">"One of my proudest possessions is the flag that the SEAL Team took with them on the mission to get bin Laden," Obama says. "On it are each of their names.  Some may be Democrats.  Some may be Republicans.  But that doesn’t matter."
        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:14 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r32">And now he returns again to the lessons that America's military personnel can teach the nation.         <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:13 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r33">The president proposes "a <strong>Veterans Job Corps </strong>that will help our communities hire veterans as cops and firefighters, so that America is as strong as those who defend her."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:12 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r34">Continuing on a theme that's a response to his Republican opponents, Obama says "America remains the one indispensable nation in world affairs – and as long as I’m president, I intend to keep it that way."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:11 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r35">"Anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you that America is in decline or that our influence has waned, doesn’t know what they’re talking about," the president continues.        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:09 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r36">"The renewal of American leadership can be felt across the globe," he says. "Our oldest alliances in Europe and Asia are stronger than ever.  Our ties to the Americas are deeper.  Our iron-clad commitment -- and I mean iron-clad -- to Israel’s security has meant the closest military cooperation between our two countries in history."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:09 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r37">Republican presidential contenders have said the president has made the nation weaker around the world. Obama responds.         <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:09 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r38">On Iran, "No Options Are Off The Table": "Let there be no doubt: America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal. ... But a peaceful resolution of this issue is still possible, and far better."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:08 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r39">"We will stand for the rights and dignity of all human beings – men and women; Christians, Muslims, and Jews," the president says. "We will support policies that lead to strong and stable democracies and open markets, because tyranny is no match for liberty."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:07 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r40">A prediction on Syria: "I have no doubt that the Assad regime will soon discover that the forces of change can’t be reversed, and that human dignity can’t be denied."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:06 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r41">"As the tide of war recedes," says the president, "a wave of change has washed across the Middle East and North Africa."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:06 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r42">He's turning back to where he began -- the end of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.         <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:05 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r43">With Or Without You: "With or without this Congress," Obama says, "I will keep taking actions that help the economy grow. But I can do a whole lot more with your help.  Because when we act together, there is nothing the United States of America can’t achieve."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:04 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r44">This Democratic president cites a Republican predecessor. "I believe what <strong>Republican Abraham Lincoln</strong> believed -- that government should do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves, and no more."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:03 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r45">Let's "lower the temperature in this town," says Obama. "We need to end the notion that the two parties must be locked in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:02 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r46">Obama turns to gridlock in Congress. "For starters," he says, "I ask the Senate to pass a rule that all judicial and public service nominations receive a simple up or down vote within 90 days."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:01 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r47">One way to battle cynicism, Obama says, would be a law that "bans insider trading by members of Congress."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:00 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r48">"Can you blame them for feeling a little cynical?" he asks.        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 10:00 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r49">Cynicism: "I bet most Americans are thinking the same thing right now," Obama says. "Nothing will get done in Washington this year, or next year, or maybe even the year after that, because Washington is broken."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 09:59 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r50">"But in return," he says, "we need to change our tax code so that people like me, and an awful lot of Members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes.  Tax reform should follow the Buffett rule:  If you make more than $1 million a year, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 09:57 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r51">Obama turns to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. "I’m prepared to make more reforms that rein in the long term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and strengthen Social Security, so long as those programs remain a guarantee of security for seniors."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 09:57 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r52">And the cameras turn to Warren Buffett's secretary, up in the gallery.

    </li>
            <li class="r53">He's turning to the Bush-era tax cuts.         <span class="date">January 24 2012, 09:55 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r54">Congress, says the president, needs to act now to stop "a tax hike on 160 million working Americans while the recovery is still fragile." He's referring to the so-called <strong>payroll tax cut</strong>.         <span class="date">January 24 2012, 09:54 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r55">Obama rolls out another initiative: "Tonight, I am asking my Attorney General to create a <strong>special unit of federal prosecutors and leading state attorneys general </strong>to expand our investigations into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the housing crisis."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 09:54 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r56">No more bailouts? Banks, says Obama, are now "required to write out a 'living will' that details exactly how you’ll pay the bills if you fail – because the rest of us aren’t bailing you out ever again."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 09:52 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r57">Aiming at Wall Street: "I will not go back to the days when Wall Street was allowed to play by its own set of rules."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 09:51 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r58">A milk joke falls flat: "We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend $10,000 a year proving that they could contain a spill – because milk was somehow classified as an oil," Obama says. "With a rule like that, I guess it was worth <strong>crying over spilled milk</strong>."         <span class="date">January 24 2012, 09:50 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r59">Watch for fact-checking on this: "I’ve approved fewer regulations in the first three years of my presidency than my Republican predecessor did in his."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 09:49 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r60">How to give "underwater" homeowners a break? "I'm sending this Congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low interest rates," Obama says.        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 09:48 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r61">"In the next few weeks," Obama says, "I will sign an executive order clearing away the red tape that slows down too many construction projects.  But you need to fund these projects.  Take the money we’re no longer spending at war, use half of it to pay down our debt, and use the rest to do some nation-building right here at home."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 09:47 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r62">Headline? "Do Some Nation Building Right Here At Home."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 09:46 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r63">On to infrastructure: "So much of America needs to be rebuilt," Obama says. "We’ve got crumbling roads and bridges.  A power grid that wastes too much energy."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 09:46 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r64">"I’m directing my administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public land to power 3 million homes.  And I’m proud to announce that the department of defense, the world’s largest consumer of energy, will make one of the largest commitments to clean energy in history – with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power a quarter of a million homes a year."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 09:45 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r65">"There’s no reason why Congress shouldn’t at least set a clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation. So far, you haven’t acted.  Well tonight, I will," Obama says.
        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 09:44 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r66">Then Obama turns his sights on the oil industry: "We have subsidized oil companies for a century.  That’s long enough.  It’s time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that’s rarely been more profitable, and double-down on a clean energy industry that’s never been more promising.   Pass clean energy tax credits and create these jobs."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 09:44 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r67">In an indirect reference to the controversial, and failed, government investment in Solyndra, the president says "some technologies don’t pan out; some companies fail.  But I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy.  I will not walk away from workers like Bryan."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 09:43 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r68">Second shout-out to someone in the House gallery: "When Bryan Ritterby was laid off from his job making furniture, he said he worried that at 55, no one would give him a second chance.  But he found work at Energetx, a wind turbine manufacturer in Michigan. Before the recession, the factory only made luxury yachts.  Today, it’s hiring workers like Bryan, who said, 'I’m proud to be working in the industry of the future.' "        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 09:42 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r69">"But with only 2 percent of the world’s oil reserves, oil isn’t enough," Obama says. "This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 09:40 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r70"><strong>Energy</strong>, and in particular Obama's hold on the so-called Keystone pipeline, has been back in the news in recent weeks. "Tonight," he says, "I’m directing my administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 09:39 PM</span>
    </li>

            <li class="r139">The president plans to address the so-called economic divide: "We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well, while a growing number of Americans barely get by," he'll say, "or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 05:59 PM</span>

            <li class="r140">According to the White House-released excerpts, Obama will talk about "the America within our reach" that has "an economy built to last, where hard work pays off, and responsibility is rewarded."        <span class="date">January 24 2012, 05:59 PM</span>

            <li class="r143">Among the president's guests tonight will be Debbie Bosanek, secretary to billionaire Warren Buffett. She symbolizes the so-called Buffett Rule -- that billionaires shouldn't pay lower tax rates than their secretaries.
