                <li class="r0">What do today's results mean? Supposedly, Mitt Romney "had" to win Ohio. He did, but not by much. And he took some thumpings from Rick Santorum in North Dakota, Oklahoma and Tennessee. Newt Gingrich's win in Georgia keeps him in the race. Ron Paul shows no sign of quitting. The battle continues.        <span class="date">March 7 2012, 12:56 AM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r1">With Ohio in his win column, Mitt Romney has victories in five states today (the others were Idaho, Massachusetts, Vermont and Virginia). Rick Santorum won in North Dakota, Oklahoma and Tennessee. Newt Gingrich won Georgia. Alaska's results will be in later.         <span class="date">March 7 2012, 12:36 AM</span>

            <li class="r2">From NPR Senior Washington Editor Ron Elving: "NPR projects that Mitt Romney will win the Republican presidential primary in Ohio and avoid a recount. Romney’s lead was approximately 1 full percentage point, well above the  0.25% margin that is the threshold for a recount under state law."        <span class="date">March 7 2012, 12:34 AM</span>

            <li class="r5">Mitt Romney has won the Ohio primary, The Associated Press just projected.         <span class="date">March 7 2012, 12:29 AM</span>

            <li class="r6">Ohio now has votes counted in 99 percent of precincts and Mitt Romney has a 10,661-vote lead over Rick Santorum -- or, 37.9 percent to Santorum's 37 percent.         <span class="date">March 7 2012, 12:26 AM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r7">Ohio law calls for an automatic recount in statewide elections if the candidate in the lead has less than a 0.25 percent advantage over the "defeated" candidate. The calculation is based on "the total vote." At this moment, Romney's 10,660 or so advantage is about 0.9 percent of the total vote.

            <li class="r8">A familiar conclusion after yet another set of Republican contests: Voters didn't give Mitt Romney "a decisive victory that could have brought a swift end to the Republican nominating contest," <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> writes.

            <li class="r9">Though Mitt Romney has pulled ahead in the state that pundits said he had to win, Politico writes that he didn't deliver a "knockout punch" in Ohio.

            <li class="r10">It's "near impossible, if not impossible" for Rick Santorum to make up the 7,000 or so votes he's now behind by, CNN's John King says.          <span class="date">March 6 2012, 11:56 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r11">The Associated Press just joined other news organizations in calling Idaho for Mitt Romney. That gives him four states to Rick Santorum's three and Newt Gingrich's one -- with Ohio still too close to call and Alaska reporting later.        <span class="date">March 6 2012, 11:52 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r12">The news networks are beginning to signal they think Mitt Romney will win Ohio. By "all indications it seems to be looking very good" for him there, CNN's Anderson Cooper just said. About 93 percent of precincts are in and Romney's lead over Rick Santorum is slightly more than 6,000 votes.         <span class="date">March 6 2012, 11:49 PM</span>

            <li class="r15">Down the ballot in Ohio's new 9th Congressional District, Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur has a solid lead over Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich.

            <li class="r16">With 90 percent of Ohio's precincts in, Mitt Romney now has a 0.5 percentage point -- about 5,000 votes -- lead over Rick Santorum.        <span class="date">March 6 2012, 11:24 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r17">The state of the race: Mitt Romney is slightly ahead of Rick Santorum in Ohio, but it's still too close to call. Santorum has won three states (N.D., Okla., Tenn.). Romney has won three states (Mass., Vt. & Va.) and likely won Idaho. Newt Gingrich won Georgia. Alaska will be late.         <span class="date">March 6 2012, 11:19 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r18">Mitt Romney has pulled ahead in the Ohio vote count, according to The Associated Press. With 85 percent of precincts reporting, he has 37.5 percent of the vote to Rick Santorum's 37.3 percent.         <span class="date">March 6 2012, 11:10 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r19">Did Democrats play a role in Ohio? <em>The New York Times</em>' FiveThirtyEight blog says that if exit polls are right and Democrats were 5 percent of the voters in the state's primary -- with 45 percent of them voting for Rick Santorum -- that was a "1 or 2 percentage point bump" for him.

    </li>
            <li class="r21">It's important to remember that nomination battles are races for convention delegates, not just votes. <em>The Plain Dealer</em> says that because of how Ohio awards delegates by congressional district, Mitt Romney "is in line" to claim 34 delegates to Rick Santorum's 22, "with the allocation of one delegate too close to call."

    </li>
            <li class="r22">Two words Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum have heard before: "virtually tied." With 79 percent of Ohio precincts reporting, they're separated by 0.2 percentage point.        <span class="date">March 6 2012, 10:54 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r23">Rick Santorum & Mitt Romney do know about tight races. They basically tied in Iowa (Santorum was given the official win there). And Santorum came close to beating Romney in Michigan. Past primary results:         (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/2011/12/29/144456395/primary-calendar-republican-delegates-and-whats-at-stake-in-each-state">link</a>) <span class="date">March 6 2012, 10:46 PM</span>

            <li class="r24">"There's every chance we can't call this race tonight," says NBC News' Chuck Todd about the Ohio primary.          (<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/#!/msnbc/status/177236840330432512">link</a>) <span class="date">March 6 2012, 10:40 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r25">The gap is less than a point now. With nearly three-quarters of Ohio's precincts reporting, Rick Santorum has just under 38 percent of votes. Mitt Romney has 37 percent.        <span class="date">March 6 2012, 10:39 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r26">"Tonight, we celebrate because of you -- the voters, volunteers & supporters who have made all of this possible," Mitt Romney tweets to supporters.

            <li class="r27">The Associated Press has also now given North Dakota to Rick Santorum.        <span class="date">March 6 2012, 10:30 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r28">Where things stand: Ohio's too close to call. Mitt Romney's won three states (Mass., Va., Vt.). It looks like Rick Santorum's won three states (N.D., Okla., Tenn.). Newt Gingrich has won one (Ga.). Two states will be late to report (Alaska, Idaho).         <span class="date">March 6 2012, 10:24 PM</span>

    </li>
            <li class="r30">It's the slow reporting from Ohio's larger cities that's keeping media outlets from calling the state for Rick Santorum, NPR Senior Washington Editor Ron Elving says. It's possible Mitt Romney could pick up enough votes from those cities to make up the gap.        <span class="date">March 6 2012, 10:18 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r31">And, "young voters are where [Mitt] Romney has real difficulty," Pew Research Center's Michael Dimock adds on the NPR broadcast.        <span class="date">March 6 2012, 10:16 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r32">Judging from exit polls, Mitt Romney is "losing by big margins among low-income voters" today, Pew Research Center's Michael Dimock tells NPR.         <span class="date">March 6 2012, 10:15 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r33">Note: With Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum so close in Ohio, there will be attention paid to the 15 percent or so of votes going to Newt Gingrich so far. What would the result be without him?        <span class="date">March 6 2012, 10:13 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r34">To recap: We're still waiting to hear from Ohio, where Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum are neck-and-neck. Romney has won three states (Massachusetts, Vermont and Virginia). Santorum has won two (Oklahoma and Tennessee). Newt Gingrich has won in Georgia. Santorum is leading in North Dakota. Alaska and Idaho will come in later.        <span class="date">March 6 2012, 10:09 PM</span>

    </li>
            <li class="r37">As he did last week after primaries in Michigan and Arizona, Mitt Romney is focusing most of his primary night address on what he would do differently from President Obama -- particularly on the economy.        <span class="date">March 6 2012, 09:59 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r38">Tightening: Just under half of precincts have reported in Ohio and Mitt Romney is now just less than 2 percentage points behind Rick Santorum.        <span class="date">March 6 2012, 09:57 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r39">Funny slip: Mitt Romney starts to say "we're going to get [President Obama] out of the out house" and with a laugh quickly corrects himself to say "White House."        <span class="date">March 6 2012, 09:55 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r40">A note on the returns so far from Ohio: The larger cities appear to be lagging in their reports. In what numbers there are from those places, Mitt Romney has been slightly ahead.        <span class="date">March 6 2012, 09:53 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r41">As Mitt Romney speaks, the latest results from the key state of Ohio show him about 3 percentage points behind Rick Santorum with about 37 percent of votes counted.         <span class="date">March 6 2012, 09:50 PM</span>

    </li>
            <li class="r43">"We're counting the delegates and that looks good," Mitt Romney says, "and we're counting down the days to November and that looks even better."        <span class="date">March 6 2012, 09:48 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r44">"What a great night," Mitt Romney tells his supporters in Boston. "There are three states under our belt tonight and counting. We're going to get more."         <span class="date">March 6 2012, 09:47 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r45">"Where he's known best, we're winning by 72 percent," Ann Romney says of her husband, Mitt, to his supporters in Boston. He was governor of Massachusetts for one term, ending in January 2007.        <span class="date">March 6 2012, 09:43 PM</span>

    </li>
            <li class="r48">Returning to what he calls "Obamacare," Rick Santorum says the election is "about fundamental liberty and the signature piece of legislation that points this out."        <span class="date">March 6 2012, 09:31 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r49">"Obamacare" and other government-run programs are "the beginning of the end of freedom in America," says Rick Santorum.        <span class="date">March 6 2012, 09:27 PM</span>

            <li class="r50">The "elites in Washington," says Rick Santorum, are telling the younger generation that they'll be putting huge deficits "on your tab and you will pay for this for the rest of your life."        <span class="date">March 6 2012, 09:25 PM</span>

            <li class="r88">Why Ohio is "too close to call": early exit polls showed men split evenly between Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum. Romney was just barely ahead among women.        <span class="date">March 6 2012, 07:58 PM</span>

            <li class="r121">Also from early "exit polls" in the seven states holding primaries today: Most GOP voters are very focused on choosing a candidate who can defeat President Obama in November, the AP says.        <span class="date">March 6 2012, 05:47 PM</span>
