                <li class="r1">Three contests (Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina). Three different results. Now it's on to Florida. Monday: An NBC News/<em>National Journal</em>/<em>Tampa Bay Times</em> debate. Thursday: CNN/Republican Party of Florida debate in Jacksonville. Jan. 31: the GOP primary.        <span class="date">January 21 2012, 10:19 PM</span>

            <li class="r2">Why did Newt Gingrich win? "Two well-watched debates in the crucial days leading up to the primary ... proved a game changer for Gingrich whose fiery debate style galvanized voters," <em>The State</em> writes.

            <li class="r3">"Upend" is the word, it appears. <em>The Washington Post</em>, <em>The New York Times</em>, NPR and Reuters say Newt Gingrich's win today has upended the race for the Republican presidential nomination.         <span class="date">January 21 2012, 10:04 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r4">Quantifying the Colbert Bump: Herman Cain got 0.1 percent of the votes in New Hampshire. Right now he's at 1 percent of the votes cast in South Carolina. So did funny guy Stephen Colbert's campaign to have a vote for Cain equal a vote for Colbert give Cain a 10x boost?        <span class="date">January 21 2012, 09:58 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r5">And Newt Gingrich, the "Comeback Kid" of 2012 who has thumped the competition today in South Carolina, says that now it's on to Florida and the rest of the race to the White House.

    </li>
            <li class="r6">Another line from Newt Gingrich aimed at President Obama: He wants energy independence so that "no American again ever bows to a Saudi king." The president's critics have been using a line like that for nearly three years:         (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2009/06/obama_unbowed_by_king_abdullah.html">link</a>) <span class="date">January 21 2012, 09:46 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r7">Newt Gingrich repeats his charge that President Obama has been "the best food stamp president" in the nation's history. PolitiFact.com rated that "barely true."

            <li class="r8">Newt Gingrich decries what he says is the "growing anti-religious bigotry of our elites."        <span class="date">January 21 2012, 09:40 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r9">If he's the Republican nominee, Newt Gingrich says, he will challenge President Obama to "seven, three-hour debates." And he'll agree to let the president use a teleprompter.         <span class="date">January 21 2012, 09:38 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r10">Turning to the current president, Newt Gingrich says that "if Barack Obama can get re-elected after this disaster ... just think how radical he would be in a second term."        <span class="date">January 21 2012, 09:37 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r11">"The genius of America is that you can come from any background" and make your case "no matter what the elites think in New York or Washington," says Newt Gingrich. And he compliments Mitt Romney for being "hard-working ... very successful" and for having done "a terrific job at the Winter Olympics" in 2002.        <span class="date">January 21 2012, 09:36 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r12">He didn't win because he's a great debater, Newt Gingrich says, but because he expresses the values that Americans hold deeply.        <span class="date">January 21 2012, 09:34 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r13">Elites from the news media and elsewhere, says Newt Gingrich, have been trying to "force us to quit being American."        <span class="date">January 21 2012, 09:32 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r14">The biggest takeaway for him from South Carolina, Newt Gingrich says, is "that is is very humbling and very sobering to have so many people who so deeply want their country to get back on the right track."        <span class="date">January 21 2012, 09:31 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r15">Newt Gingrich jokes that everyone in South Carolina was great, including those who "by accident or misinformation were for the other candidates."        <span class="date">January 21 2012, 09:30 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r16">As we wait for Newt Gingrich to speak, another musical note: His staff has also rocked the crowd with Blur's <em>Song 2</em> -- a staple of sports arenas everywhere.        <span class="date">January 21 2012, 09:25 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r17">The Santorum and Gingrich campaigns agree on one thing: Journey's <em>Don't Stop Believin' </em>is the song to play on a primary night, win or lose.         <span class="date">January 21 2012, 09:19 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r18">Newt Gingrich's supporters are ready to roar in South Carolina. Today's winner is expected to address them shortly.         <span class="date">January 21 2012, 09:12 PM</span>

            <li class="r19">With a very big and very noncommittal shrug, Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) says "I'm not in the business of choosing" after he's asked on CNN if he likes any of the other three GOP contenders as an alternative to him.        <span class="date">January 21 2012, 09:02 PM</span>

            <li class="r35">In a volatile race, at least one thing is now clear, NPR.org's Alan Greenblatt writes: "Newt Gingrich has emerged as the most serious threat to the hopes of Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor."

            <li class="r36">"This is one heck of a setback" for Mitt Romney, though conventional wisdom still has him being the likely Republican presidential nominee, NPR's Mara Liasson says on our broadcast.

            <li class="r37">She continues to believe that Mitt Romney "would be the best candidate to defeat President Obama and strengthen our country again," South Carolina Gov.

            <li class="r38">Again targeting Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney says he expected a "frontal assault on free enterprise" from Democrats, but not such attacks from fellow Republicans who have criticized his business record.         <span class="date">January 21 2012, 08:05 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r39">In going after President Obama, Mitt Romney takes indirect aim at Newt Gingrich. The president, he says, has never led a business or a state and the Republican Party "can't be led to victory by someone who also has never led a business or a state."        <span class="date">January 21 2012, 08:03 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r40">Mitt Romney turns immediately to the next contest, saying that President Obama has failed to turn the economy around and thus has failed voters in Florida and elsewhere who want to see more jobs created.

            <li class="r44">Former Sen. Rick Santorum, who has had some harsh things to say in the past about Newt Gingrich's record as speaker of the House, tells CNN: "Those who've worked with Newt Gingrich know what's in store" for the Republican party if Gingrich is the nominee.
